# ASUU Suspends Eight-Month Strike

The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has officially announced the suspension of its eight-month-long industrial action. The decision was reached after a marathon meeting of the union's National Executive Council (NEC) which started on Thursday night and ended early Friday morning.

The strike, which commenced on February 14, 2022, was in response to the government's failure to meet the union's demands, which include the revitalization of public universities, payment of earned academic allowances, and the deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for the payment of university lecturers' salaries.

Following the suspension of the strike, academic activities are expected to resume in public universities across the country.

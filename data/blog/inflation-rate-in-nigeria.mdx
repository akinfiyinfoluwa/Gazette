# Nigeria's Inflation Rate Surges to 22.79%

Nigeria's inflation rate rose to 22.79% in June 2025, the highest in 18 years, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The latest inflation figure is a 0.38% point increase from the 22.41% recorded in the previous month.

The NBS report attributed the rise in inflation to the increase in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel, clothing and footwear, and transport.

The food inflation rate in June 2025 was 25.25% on a year-on-year basis, which was 4.65% points higher compared to the rate recorded in June 2024 (20.60%).

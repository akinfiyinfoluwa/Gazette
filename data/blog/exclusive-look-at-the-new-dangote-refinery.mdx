# An Exclusive Look at the New Dangote Refinery

Gazette takes you on an exclusive tour of the new Dangote Refinery, the largest single-train refinery in the world. The refinery, which is located in the Lekki Free Zone in Lagos, Nigeria, is expected to be a game-changer for the Nigerian economy.

The refinery has a capacity to process 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and is expected to meet 100% of Nigeria's demand for all refined products, with a surplus for export.

The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and boost the local economy. It is also expected to save Nigeria billions of dollars in foreign exchange that is currently spent on importing refined petroleum products.
